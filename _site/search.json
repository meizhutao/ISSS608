This data file consists of 199,999 rows of time-series cyber attack records by country.\n\n\nImporting the data\nFirst, you will use the code chunk below to import eventlog.csv file into R environment and called the data frame as attacks.\n\nattacks <- read_csv(\"data/eventlog.csv\")\n\n\n\nExamining the data structure\nIt is always a good practice to examine the imported data frame before further analysis is performed.\nFor example, kable() can be used to review the structure of the imported data frame.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\nsource_country\ntz\n\n\n\n\n2015-03-12 15:59:16\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:00:48\nFR\nEurope/Paris\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:26\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:38\nUS\nAmerica/Chicago\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:22\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:45\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three columns, namely timestamp, source_country and tz.\n\ntimestamp field stores date-time values in POSIXct format.\nsource_country field stores the source of the attack.

In this step, we will write a function to perform the task.\n\nmake_hr_wkday <- function(ts, sc, tz) {\n  real_times <- ymd_hms(ts, \n                        tz = tz[1], \n                        quiet = TRUE)\n  dt <- data.table(source_country = sc,\n                   wkday = weekdays(real_times),\n                   hour = hour(real_times))\n  return(dt)\n  }\n\nNote: ymd_hms() and hour() are from lubridate package and weekdays() is a base R function.\nStep 2: Deriving the attacks tibble data frame\n\nwkday_levels <- c('Saturday', 'Friday', \n                  'Thursday', 'Wednesday', \n                  'Tuesday', 'Monday', \n                  'Sunday')\n\nattacks <- attacks %>%\n  group_by(tz) %>%\n  do(make_hr_wkday(.$timestamp, \n                   .$source_country, \n                   .$tz)) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  mutate(wkday = factor(\n    wkday, levels = wkday_levels),\n    hour  = factor(\n      hour, levels = 0:23))\n\nNote: Beside extracting the necessary data into attacks data frame, mutate() of dplyr package is used to convert wkday and hour fields into factor so they’ll be ordered when plotting\nTable below shows the tidy tibble table after processing.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntz\nsource_country\nwkday\nhour\n\n\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nBG\nSaturday\n20\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n6\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nTW\nSunday\n8\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCN\nSunday\n11\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nUS\nSunday\n15\n\n\nAfrica/Cairo\nCA\nMonday\n11\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding the Calendar Heatmaps\n\ngrouped <- attacks %>% \n  count(wkday, hour) %>% \n  ungroup() %>%\n  na.omit()\n\nggplot(grouped, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \ngeom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \ntheme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \ncoord_equal() +\nscale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\nlabs(x = NULL, \n     y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks by weekday and time of day\") +\ntheme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n      plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n      legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n      legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk: - a tibble data table called grouped is derived by aggregating the attack by wkday and hour fields. - a new field called n is derived by using group_by() and count() functions. - na.omit() is used to exclude missing value. - geom_tile() is used to plot tiles (grids) at each x and y position. color and size arguments are used to specify the border color and line size of the tiles. - theme_tufte() of ggthemes package is used to remove unnecessary chart junk. To learn which visual components of default ggplot2 have been excluded, you are encouraged to comment out this line to examine the default plot. - coord_equal() is used to ensure the plot will have an aspect ratio of 1:1. - scale_fill_gradient() function is used to creates a two colour gradient (low-high).\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we can simply group the count by hour and wkday and plot it, since we know that we have values for every combination there’s no need to further preprocess the data.\n\n\nBuilding Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nChallenge: Building multiple heatmaps for the top four countries with the highest number of attacks.\n\n\n\nPlotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 1: Deriving attack by country object\nIn order to identify the top 4 countries with the highest number of attacks, you are required to do the followings:\n\ncount the number of attacks by country,\ncalculate the percent of attackes by country, and\nsave the results in a tibble data frame.\n\n\nattacks_by_country <- count(\n  attacks, source_country) %>%\n  mutate(percent = percent(n/sum(n))) %>%\n  arrange(desc(n))\n\nStep 2: Preparing the tidy data frame\nIn this step, you are required to extract the attack records of the top 4 countries from attacks data frame and save the data in a new tibble data frame (i.e. top4_attacks).\n\ntop4 <- attacks_by_country$source_country[1:4]\ntop4_attacks <- attacks %>%\n  filter(source_country %in% top4) %>%\n  count(source_country, wkday, hour) %>%\n  ungroup() %>%\n  mutate(source_country = factor(\n    source_country, levels = top4)) %>%\n  na.omit()\n\n\n\nPlotting Multiple Calendar Heatmaps\nStep 3: Plotting the Multiple Calender Heatmap by using ggplot2 package.\n\nggplot(top4_attacks, \n       aes(hour, \n           wkday, \n           fill = n)) + \n  geom_tile(color = \"white\", \n          size = 0.1) + \n  theme_tufte(base_family = \"Helvetica\") + \n  coord_equal() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(name = \"# of attacks\",\n                    low = \"sky blue\", \n                    high = \"dark blue\") +\n  facet_wrap(~source_country, ncol = 2) +\n  labs(x = NULL, y = NULL, \n     title = \"Attacks on top 4 countries by weekday and time of day\") +\n  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank(),\n        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 7),\n        plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),\n        legend.title = element_text(size = 8),\n        legend.text = element_text(size = 6) )"

From the derived values which is population in percentage, we will not know what is the number of female and male population difference from the 9 most populated planning areas.\n\n\n4.2.3 Reference line\nIn the remake, the reference line is added which is the avg population (sum of total population divided by 9 planning areas/19 age groups/2 genders).\n\n\n4.2.4 interactive function\nAdd on interactive function into the chart to show the population numbers when move cursor."

However, this display does not show a clear comparison betewwn male and female population. It does not help user to distinguish the genders from the 1st attention. . It’s suggested to choose two different colors to indicate the two different genders in this visualization.\n\n\n4.3.2 X-Axis Title & Labels\nThe population number is large. It’s good to show number in the unit of thousand With the aid of the newly added x-axis title and labels, it makes it easier for users to read and interpret this visualization. The X-axis labels will be converted to positive values because population should be positive values.\n\n\n4.3.3 Caption\nThe caption to mention the data source for this visualization has also been included at the bottom in a clean manner."

When looking at the numbers of flats, we can see that SENGKANG, PUNGGOL and YISHUN have the most of the flats of all flat types.This could be seen in section 5.3 Proportion and absolute numbers of flat types in Singapore.\nLocation had a great effect on flat resale prices. Generally, the CENTRAL AREA had the most expensive flats by mean price per square meter followed by QUEENSTOWN and KALLANG. This could be seen from the box plots and uncertainty of point estimates in section 5.4.2 Average resale prices by room type by planning areas.\nFinding 2 - Resale price and remaining lease year, floor area sqm, Time(months) Generally, there is no strong correlation between the unit price and remaining lease, unit price and floor area sqm. This could be seen in section 5.5 Resale price by remaining_lease_year and 5.6 Resale prices by floor_area_sqm.\nThere is no significant increasing or decreasing trend of resale price over months.This could be seen in section 5.7 resalse price by time(sale months).\nFinding 3 - Resale price by storey_range For 3 Room flat type, the unit prices are higher at YISHUN, ANG MIAO KIAO, BEDOK, storey ranging from 04-06 to 07-09. For 4 Room flat type, the unit prices are higher at SENGKANG, PUNGGOL, YISHUN, storey ranging from 07-09, 10-12 to 13-15. For 5 Room flat type, the unit prices are higher at SENGKANG, PUNGGOL, JURONG WEST, storey ranging from 07-09, 10-12 to 13-15. This could be seen in section 5.7 Resale price by storey_range."
