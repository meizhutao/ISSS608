From the derived values which is population in percentage, we will not know what is the number of female and male population difference from the 9 most populated planning areas.\n\n\n4.2.3 Reference line\nIn the remake, the reference line is added which is the avg population (sum of total population divided by 9 planning areas/19 age groups/2 genders).\n\n\n4.2.4 interactive function\nAdd on interactive function into the chart to show the population numbers when move cursor."

However, this display does not show a clear comparison betewwn male and female population. It does not help user to distinguish the genders from the 1st attention. . It’s suggested to choose two different colors to indicate the two different genders in this visualization.\n\n\n4.3.2 X-Axis Title & Labels\nThe population number is large. It’s good to show number in the unit of thousand With the aid of the newly added x-axis title and labels, it makes it easier for users to read and interpret this visualization. The X-axis labels will be converted to positive values because population should be positive values.\n\n\n4.3.3 Caption\nThe caption to mention the data source for this visualization has also been included at the bottom in a clean manner."
